Project Title: Binary Number
Project Desc: Purpose: This project involves turning a decimal into a binary number
				Input: any decimal value
				Output: The binary code for that decimal value
				Process:
Version: 1.0.0 - created files and created structures and classes for stack.h and queue.h
		 1.0.1 - created cpp files for stack and queue as well as main file
		 1.0.2 - Binary code output was displaying 6 bits instead of 8, 
				changed while loop for binary function to a more optimal code (includes counter and 8 bit if statement) 
		 1.0.3 - created a while loop to enter multiple decimal values over until responding with no (n)
